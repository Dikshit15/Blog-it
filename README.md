# my-first-blog

So this is basically my First Attempt at creating something fun in Django. This is basically a blogging app where users 
can go, create account, add and delete posts. 
An interesting feature I added was that whenever a user sends in request for signup, a one-time link is sent to the local 
server after acctivation which a user account is created.
